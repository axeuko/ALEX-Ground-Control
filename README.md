# ALEX-Ground-Control
ALEX stands for Autonomous Land Exploration. It is an Ground Vehicle that can operate both autonomously and remotely. I will be showing the frontend and backend design of the web application that allows for remote operation of ALEX 

NB: I built the Vehichle but will only be sharing the remote Motion control  

the programming languages used for this project includes:- python, flask(python-framework), HTML, CSS, Javascript

The motor functions of the Vehichle are controlled using Arduino so the Flask server i created talks to the arduino in response to the buttons clicked on the front end.
I have uploaded my flask app package which contains all the files for the operation of the vehicle
